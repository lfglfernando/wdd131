      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Fernando Galvez and I am 22 years old, born in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. My love for programming began a year ago when I received an offer to take a 6-month intensive course to be a full-stack developer. While taking that course I knew that this was the career I wanted to study.
        Then enter online college with a Software Development degree at Brigham Young University - Idaho. There I began to learn many super important basics, 6 months after finishing my intensive programming course I got a job as a Junior Developer and I realized that I needed to improve my English to be more competitive in my career, so I moved to the United States to master the English language and then be able to work for a software company in the United States.
        Today I am working in a software company called CRMB, my role in this company is to be an application specialist, knowing how it works to be able to train our clients. I hope later to be more involved in the development side.

        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        In our home page, we aim to create a welcoming atmosphere with user-friendly navigation. The wireframe may not reflect our chosen color scheme and background imagery, which will be carefully curated to resonate with our brand's identity and offer an engaging visual experience.

      <h3>My Portfolio</h3>
      <p>     
        Our portfolio section will showcase a diverse range of projects, but the wireframe doesn't convey the interactive features. Visitors can click on each project to access detailed information, images, and links to project resources, creating an immersive and informative journey through our work.

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>         
        This is the section about me, where i am talking about my personality, my personal interest and myself, but i think that the most important thing about this 'about me' is that i explain about my technichal skills.
